# Question 1 (concept)[20p]

For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

a) The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.
b) The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.
c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
d) The variance of the error terms, $Var(\epsilon)$, is extremely high.

# Answer 1

a) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
b) consectetur adipiscing elit
c) sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
d)  et dolore magna aliqua.


# Question 2 (concept)[10p]
Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate
whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide $n$ and $p$.

a) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record
profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in
understanding which factors affect CEO salary.
b) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be
a _success_ or a _failure_. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously
launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure,
price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other
variables.
c) We are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro exchange rate in
relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly
data for all of 2012. For each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the
% change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change
in the German market.

# Answer 2
a) Ut enim ad minim veniam
b) quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi
c) ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.


# Question 3 (concept)[20p]
We now revisit the bias-variance decomposition.

a) Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training mean squared error,
test mean squared error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error rate curves, on a single
plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible
approaches. The $x$-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method,
and the $y$-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five
curves. Make sure to label each one.

b) Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a)

# Answer 3
a) Here, either you're going to sketch the graph, take a picture and attach it (make sure you are using the right file format, for example it could be .jpg or .png), this way:

![Bailey](C:/Users/dcste/OneDrive/Senior_Year_Second_Semester/Econ_490/Homework/Econ_490_HW/Calculus II (2).jpg){width=.2in}
 
 or make your graph directly in R:  
```{r}
plot(x1 <- seq(0, 20, 0.01), y1 <-cos(x1), type="l",  main="main title", xlab="x-axis label", ylab="y-axis label", col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


b) Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

# Question 4 (concept)[20p]
The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable 

+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Obs. | $X_1$ | $X_2$ | $X_3$ |  $Y$  |
+======+=======+=======+=======+=======+
|  1)  |   0   |   3   |   0   | Red   |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  2)  |   2   |   0   |   0   | Red   |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  3)  |   0   |   1   |   3   | Red   |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  4)  |   0   |   1   |   2   | Green |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  5)  |  -1   |   0   |   1   | Green |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  6)  |   1   |   1   |   1   | Red   |
+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for $Y$ when $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0$ using K-nearest neighbors.

(a) Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0$.

(Note: the Euclidean distance of two vectors $a = (a_1,a_2,a_3)$ and $b = (b_1,b_2,b_3)$ is
given by $d(a,b) = \sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + (a_3-b_3)^2}$. The same idea extends to vectors with $n$ coordinates.)

b) What is our prediction with K = 1? Why?
c) What is our prediction with K = 3? Why?
d) If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we
expect the best value for K to be large or small? Why?

# Answer 4
a) Here it would be recommended to create a table (or choose any way want to provide your answer):

+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
| Obs. | $X_1$ | $X_2$ | $X_3$ | $d\big(obs, (0,0,0) \big)$ |
+======+=======+=======+=======+============================+
|  1)  |   0   |   3   |   0   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
|  2)  |   2   |   0   |   0   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
|  3)  |   0   |   1   |   3   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
|  4)  |   0   |   1   |   2   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
|  5)  |  -1   |   0   |   1   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+
|  6)  |   1   |   1   |   1   |              ?             |
+------+-------+-------+-------+----------------------------+

b) Red or Green?
c) Red or Green?
d) Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.


# Question 5 (applied)[30p for part (c)]
This exercise relates to the College data set, It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are

- Private: Public/private indicator
- Apps: Number of applications received
- Accept: Number of applicants accepted
- Enroll: Number of new students enrolled
- Top10perc: New students from top 10
- Top25perc: New students from top 25
- F.Undergrad: Number of full-time undergraduates
- P.Undergrad: Number of part-time undergraduates
- Outstate: Out-of-state tuition
- Room.Board: Room and board costs
- Books: Estimated book costs
- Personal: Estimated personal spending
- PhD: Percent of faculty with Ph.D.'s
- Terminal: Percent of faculty with terminal degree
- S.F.Ratio: Student/faculty ratio
- perc.alumni: Percent of alumni who donate
- Expend: Instructional expenditure per student
- Grad.Rate: Graduation rate

Before reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.

a) Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data. The R commands getwd() and setwd() may be helpful.

b) Look at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don't really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rownames(college) <- college[, 1]
View(college)
```

You should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try

```{r, eval=FALSE}
college <- college[, -1]
View(college)
```

Now you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.

c) 
i. Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in
the data set.
ii. Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns
or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a
matrix A using A[,1:10].
iii. Use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus
Private.
iv. Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc
variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or
not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes
exceeds 50%.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
Elite <- rep("No", nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc > 50] <- "Yes"
Elite <- as.factor(Elite)
college <- data.frame(college, Elite)
```

Use the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.

v. Use the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of
bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow
= c(2, 2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four
plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will
divide the screen in other ways.

vi. Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.

# Answer 5 (applied)

For the applied questions all the written code needs to be provided, including the display. If you are going to display data (or large data.frames/matrices), please use the head() function in R to display just a small part of it.  


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
head(cars)
```
